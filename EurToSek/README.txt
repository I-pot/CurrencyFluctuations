This is a freetime project of mine where I study curreny flcutuations.

The file sek.xml containt the daily currency exchange rates since 1999 for Eur to Sek.
This is then unpacked into nicer format by Analyse_sek.py and written to data file sek.dat
The python file also contains some figures that one might be intesrested in.
